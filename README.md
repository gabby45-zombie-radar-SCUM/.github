# 🧟 SCUM Zombie Radar – Stay One Step Ahead of the Infected

If you’ve played *SCUM* for more than 10 minutes, you know how annoying zombies (infected) can be. Silent until they’re biting your neck, blocking every loot spot, or swarming bunkers like it's Black Friday. That’s where the **Zombie Radar ESP** comes in — a powerful visual cheat that shows you **exactly where every infected is hiding**, no matter the location, distance, or terrain.

This isn’t a gimmick — it’s survival tech.

## 🔍 What Is the Zombie Radar in SCUM?

The **zombie radar** is a built-in feature of the SCUM ESP cheat that specifically tracks all infected in real time. No more walking into blind ambushes, getting chased mid-farm, or panicking inside a bunker. With zombie radar turned on, you’ll see:

* 🧟 Infected location through walls and floors
* 🔴 Aggro state (calm, alert, chasing)
* 📏 Distance from you
* ✅ Visibility checks (if they can see you)
* 🧠 Special zombie types (explosive, military, hazmat)

Perfect for PvE mains, stealth looters, and players who just want to **survive without getting chewed on every 5 minutes**.
